  // 2
  //   So, what we're going to do now, as I just said,
  // is to use the useEffect Hook
  // to keep this duration state here in sync
  // with all these other state variables.
  // Now, notice how I said earlier in that long lecture
  // about the useEffect Hook,
  // that this is exactly what we usually should not do.
  // However, I think that in this situation,
  // this is a perfectly fine use case for the useEffect Hook,
  // because there are so many state variables here involved,
  // that it just becomes very impractical,
  // and even unreadable and confusing to do it in a way
  // that I just demonstrated you.
  // And so again,
  // we should instead use an effect in this situation.
  useEffect(
    function () {
      setDuration((number * sets * speed) / 60 + (sets - 1) * durationBreak);
    },
    [number, sets, speed, durationBreak]
  );

  // 3
  //   So, only updating once, which we would think
  // only gives us one render.
  // But actually, we do have two renders.
  // So the calculator is rendered.
  // And then again, and so this is exactly the problem
  // of the useEffect Hook to update states.
  // So, right here.
  // So basically, this first state update
  // is this number of sets updating,
  // which will then trigger this effect here.
  // But the effect only runs
  // after the render has already happened.
  // And so then when we set the state here again,
  // we get a second render.
  // So React is not able to batch these two renders in one,
  // simply because, again, the effect actually runs
  // way after the render has already happened.
  // And so just be aware of that issue
  // whenever you do something like this.
  // So, whenever you can, again, avoid this.
  // But when you have so many state variables here
  // that influence the value of another state,
  // then you can do this.
